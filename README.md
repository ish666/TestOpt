# 🧪 TestOpt - Test Optimization Library

**TestOpt** is a Python library for optimizing test cases using multiple AI/ML-based and heuristic techniques.  
It helps reduce testing time, increase fault coverage, and improve software reliability.
Python library that automatically optimizes software test suites using machine learning, mutation testing, and heuristic methods. It helps prioritize and reduce test cases to improve efficiency and fault coverage.
